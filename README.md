## Roadmap
The Project will be impemented using the Iterative incremental model.Its SDLC roadmap is as follows:
1. System conception.
2. Requirement specification.
3. Software design.
4. Coding/Implementation.
5. System integration.
6. Testing.
7. Software Quality assurance.
8. System installation.
9. Software maintainance.




 
## 1. System Conception
    Every project needs a Project Management tool that can easily manage the budget, quality and documentation for projects. 

The Project Management software will be a web application that will enable teams to manage tasks, resources/funds, communicate and ultimately achieve the project goals.

PMs (Project Managers) can create a project schedule and track the progress.They can also  create a budget and track the project expenses all within one tool.
The software also involves Stakeholders who can view the project progress and current expenditure from their dashboard.

    The software's objectives include:

1. Scheduling-The fundamental goal of scheduling is to arrange a sequence of activities or events, and the intricacy of the schedule can vary greatly depending on how the tool is applied.
2. Handling project-related information - the project planning software will provide information to team members,Project Managers and stakeholders. 
3. Acquire visibility and insight - from the software,you can view the deliverables, dependencies, scheduling drivers, and data changes for your project.
4. Collaboration and communication - to share information and coordinate efforts among project teams to improve participation, progress reporting, and other project-related activities.

    The Software will handle:
- Task management.
